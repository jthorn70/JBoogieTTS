# JBoogieTTS
JBoogieTTS created by jboondock
will update soon


# Installation
To install, clone this repo to your desired location. Run the Install.py file. You will need to open the twitchbot.py file and change a few things in there such as your uberduck API keys and secrets as well as your OAUTH key for the twitch bot. There are also file paths for the wav files you need to set.  Run the Run.py file once everything is setup. 

I will look into streamlining the setup process at another point.
